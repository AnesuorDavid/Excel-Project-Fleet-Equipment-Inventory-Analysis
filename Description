Fleet Equipment Inventory Analysis
This project demonstrates an analysis of fleet equipment data for a local government office using Excel. The goal was to utilize pivot tables to derive actionable insights on fleet distribution and support decision-making for inventory management.

Project Summary
As part of this analysis, I formatted fleet data, calculated essential statistics, and created pivot tables to explore equipment distribution across departments and vehicle classes. These tasks laid the foundation for a data findings report and visual dashboard.

Key Steps Completed
1. Data Formatting
Formatted the fleet inventory data into a structured table to facilitate efficient analysis and allow for advanced data manipulation.
2. Summary Statistics with AutoSum
Using AutoSum, I calculated key metrics for column "C," including:
SUM: Total count of equipment.
AVERAGE: Mean equipment count.
MIN and MAX: Minimum and maximum values.
COUNT: Number of entries.
3. Initial Pivot Table Creation and Sorting
Created a pivot table with Department in the Rows and Equipment Count in the Values, showing the sum of equipment count by department.
Sorted the pivot table data in descending order to quickly identify departments with the largest equipment holdings.
4. Additional Pivot Tables for Detailed Analysis
Created two more pivot tables to examine data from different perspectives:
Pivot Table 2: Placed Equipment Class below Department to show equipment types within each department, keeping Transportation expanded.
Pivot Table 3: Arranged Equipment Class above Department to display each vehicle type followed by its associated departments, with CUV expanded.
5. Finalizing the Workbook
Saved the completed workbook as Montgomery_Fleet_Equipment_Inventory_FA_PART_2_END.XLSX, capturing all steps for reproducibility.
Project Outcome
This analysis provides a clear, organized view of fleet equipment distribution by department and vehicle class. These insights enable better planning and resource allocation, supporting informed decision-making in fleet management.
